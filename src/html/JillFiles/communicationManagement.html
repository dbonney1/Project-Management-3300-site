      <h1>Project Communication Management</h1>
      <p>
        A project manager must know the communication process, and what is
        involved to be effective in communicating with the team and the
        stakeholders. Effective communication uses three processes that ensure
        information is sent, received, and understood by the appropriate
        parties. Good communication is essential to thwart any type of
        miscommunication breakdown that could have a negative impact on the
        team’s productivity and the final product.
      </p>
      <p>
        This video gives a summary of Project Communications management and that
        the project manager should understand the team’s genuine issues and be
        in touch with the challenges of the project. It is not just about
        speaking to and hearing from people. It is about understanding the
        complete message to ensure a successful project.
