      <h1>Project Control Scheduling</h1>
      <p>
        Control Scheduling is a practice in project management that requires
        monitoring the status of events connected to a specific design /
        project. It also entails continually updating the projects development
        as well as controlling changes to the schedule to reach the desired
        ending. To make the best possible schedule and keep control of it helps
        with the deliverables and to get the project to the customer on time.
        Some simple techniques for scheduling a project are:
      </p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Defining activities and breaking them down into smaller tasks</li>
        <li>Correlating similar tasks</li>
        <li>
          Sequencing activities: estimate a time frame required for each task
        </li>
        <li>Appointing ample individuals to each task</li>
        <li>Calculating the time needed for each task</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal of these techniques helps the project manager and the teams to
        understand what is expected of them and to plan any corrective actions
        to help manage the changes to the basic schedule. These actions will
        help reduce any type of risks for the delivery of the product or
        services when it is managed well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defining the work plainly is essential to all projects. If there are
        misunderstandings about the activities and what is expected, there is
        the possibility that the schedule may be unrealistic and maybe multiple
        changes which may put the project further behind. This brief video goes
        over Project Control Management.
