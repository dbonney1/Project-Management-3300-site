      <h1>Project Risk Management</h1>
      <p>
        What is Project Risk Management you ask? Well, it is the method of
        identifying, analyzing and then reacting to any risk(s) that may arise
        over the development of a project. This plan will help the project and
        team remain on their path and meet its goal(s). When do I start using
        Risk management? Well, it should be a part of the planning process and
        used to figure out what risk(s) might happen in the project and how to
        get control of the threat quickly if it does happen. However, looking
        for risks throughout the entire project is good practice, as you may be
        able to head off an unforeseen problem. Risk management can entail
        myriad items on different types of projects. Such as on a large-scale
        project, strategies could contain vast detailed planning for each risk
        to ensure relief strategies are in place if issues arise. However, risk
        management may mean something as a simple prioritized list of risks
        labeled as high, medium, or low threat(s) to the timetable and project
        for smaller projects.

        This short video on Risk Analysis shows the planning process for risk
        management planning, identifying risks, possible impacts of a risk,
        response and risk levels.

        In this video Mike Clayton explains what risks are, how they could
        impact a project and how Project Risk Management is used to try to
        mitigate these risks.
