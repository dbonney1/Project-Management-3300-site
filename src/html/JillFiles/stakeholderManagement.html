      <h1>What is Project Stakeholder Management?</h1>
      <p>
        A project is prosperous when it accomplishes its goals and meets or
        surpasses the ideas of the stakeholders. Who are the stakeholders? These
        are the people who are either presently involved in the production of or
        have an interest in the process and outcome of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this video Mike Clayton explains what stakeholder management is and
        how opening up dialog with these stakeholders and engaging them is one
        of the most important parts of Project Management.

        Another great aspect of Project Stakeholder management is learning how
        to identify who the stakeholders are. In the following video, you are
        shown how to identify these individuals and how to communicate with them
        in the best way.

      <p>
        The benefits of conducting good engagement in project stakeholder
        management is the trust you earn with the stakeholders, the possibility
        of improving risk management which can save time and money. There are
        risks with stakeholder management as well. Conflicts and the loss of
        control of your schedule or agenda can cost not only you but the
        stakeholders time and money. Balancing effective stakeholder engagement
        will be a benefit to everyone.
