      <h1>Project Cost Management</h1>
      <p>
        One essential task of the Cost Management Area is estimating cost and
        coming up with a budget. There is a lot of terminology you need to
        understand for project cost management. Below are a few basic terms that
        may help you when you are beginning your budgeting and money management
        part of the project.
      </p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Actual cost is the amount of money spent on a task, or any part of a project.</li>
        <li>Budget is the amount of money you will need to work on and deliver your deliverables or project.</li>
        <li>Contingency is a condition or plan you make for anything you do not know enough about yet to be housed within your budget. A contingency is supposed to address a particular risk, like not having all the estimates for delivering a piece of work you will be doing.</li>
        <li>Controlling costs is addressing different variations to avoid cost overruns.</li>
        <li>Cost Overrun is the actual cost that exceeds the estimation cost in the budget.</li>
        <li>Direct costs are the ones that can be directly traced to a distinct object, task, or project. These costs may include such items as equipment directly purchased for the project and team member’s salaries.</li>
        <li>Estimation cost or Rough order of magnitude (ROM) is a guess at how much an item, task, or time will cost. Estimating cost ought to be the best educated guess possible, because effect of getting it wrong can be significant. Estimating costs can range from less than a year to 5 years, depending on what technique or tool you are using. There are estimating strategies and tools to help take the speculation out of calculating estimates. </li>
        <li>Indirect costs are the costs that cannot be directly connected with a precise cost object. These can include such items as staples, janitorial staff, etc.</li>
        <li>Reserve cost is like contingency, except it is an actual pot of money set aside to deal with unexpected problems that arise, i.e., missing deadlines.</li>
        <li>Sunk costs are costs already suffered on your project that you can not get back. These costs are most relevant when talking about whether you should close a project. If that should happen, you will not be able to recoup the sunk costs at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be effective in managing project costs, project managers need to understand several basic principles. Estimating costs is an exceedingly vital part of project cost management. There are different levels to estimating costs and each type is done during a different phase of the project life cycle. Several various tools and techniques can help you with your estimation.
