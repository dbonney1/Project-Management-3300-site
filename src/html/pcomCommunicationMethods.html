      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether you have previous experience managing a project or simply being a team member, you’ve likely experienced an awkward situation where several team members are operating in complete isolation, while another member seems to want to carry the team but does not effectively communicate their ingenious ideas, and everyone else is completely dumbfounded and scrambling to make progress on the project. It is evident that the elusive panacea of communication has completely escaped this hypothetical team, and only disaster can ensue. While communication may seem like common sense and mindless, a variety of different communication media exist, and some are more appropriate than others for a given situation. As an example, many people dislike face-to-face meetings and would prefer to avoid them at all costs; however, sometimes this is necessary, as it can facilitate the exchange of salient information. Undoubtedly, knowing some of the most popular communication methods as well as their applications can help you regardless of your position.
      </p>
      <h2 id="communication-methods">Communication Methods</h2>
      <p>
        As previously mentioned, a variety of communications methods exist, and, while you it is not necessary to know every available platform like the back of your hand, more general communication method categories exist, and having a fundamental understanding of each and when to apply them will provide a strong foundation for your team’s communicative ability. The three major communication method classifications include interactive communication, push communication, and pull communication; through delving into these, you can begin to explore potential options to more flexibly apply each of these communication methods to your team’s environment and needs. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="interactive-communication">Interactive Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Interactive communication is the classic method of communication that entails face-to-face interaction between two or more people. The dominant advantage of interactive communication methods is the virtually nonexistent signal-to-reception factor, given that a given piece of information can be exchanged, processed, and scrutinized almost instantaneously. The mantra of “face-to-face” does not necessarily refer to the physical proximity between team members; while a physical meeting is certainly a form of interactive communication, the modern era has opened many new technologies and opportunities to hold team meetings, such as teleconference software. As a project manager, you may ponder the potential applications for interactive communication versus other, more convenient options such as e-mail. One hypothetical example would be if you or a project team member discovered a major bug in your software that needs to be inspected immediately; if you were to simply email your team, its members may not open the email until the damage has already been done, or the exchange of solutions and other related information may be too cumbersome through such a medium. Interactive communication would be almost infinitely superior as an option because of the ability to provide immediate feedback and contributions.
      </p>
      <h2 id="push-communication">Push Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Push communication encompasses a category of communication that is not so focused on a constant flow of interaction, as it is biased toward a “sender-to-receiver” paradigm, through which information is distributed to one or multiple individuals. Some common examples of push communication would be e-mail, letters, formal reports, and memos. The most perceivable advantage of push communication methods is the high degree of convenience; the sender only has the responsibility of deploying the e-mail/letter/report/etc., but many tend to misuse push communication methods through a zealous overreliance on this convenience. The sender has no indication of knowing that every intended recipient received the message until those recipients send a response, if any. This low and potentially unreliable signal-to-reception rate can make certain issues difficult to clarify, and it may be possible that the audience does not fully comprehend the nature of the message, meaning that a face-to-face meeting could be more appropriate in particular scenarios. However, push communication is still applicable for virtually all information that is not especially urgent and where immediate action is not necessary.
      </p>
      <h2 id="pull-communication">Pull Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Pull communication pertains to a classification of communication methods through which a large audience must be reached, which are typically used for complex projects. Rather than using the more confidential methods exclusive to push and interactive communication, pull communication can provide information through a blog, official company website, bulletin boards, public database or social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Pull communication could be utilized to provide a consistent flow of updates to stakeholders investing in a new platform or product that your team is currently developing. Sponsors and other involved groups often have the option to subscribe to this feed so that they can receive periodic updates on project progress and learn about new features as they are implemented. Furthermore, once a product is deployed you could choose to supply helpful documentation through a website in order to guide users as they learn the ins and outs of the software system or application. It’s additionally important to note that recipients not reading content provided through pull communication should not negatively impact your project’s development, as information will only be retrieved as it is needed.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, it is evident that a vast array of communication methods exist, despite the concept of team communication ostensibly seeming to be second nature for many. While many prefer the convenience of push and pull communication media, such as e-mail, letters, websites and blogs, urgent and sensitive information is not particular appropriate for either, considering it is possible that some recipients may not open the message until several days or weeks after it is sent, implying they read it at all. Through assimilating your project management skills and applying them, along with a dash of critical thinking, to the context of communication among your team members and other stakeholders, you can be certain that the quality of your projects will benefit exponentially.
