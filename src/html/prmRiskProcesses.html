      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether you’re a seasoned veteran of project management or an undergraduate college student, you have likely been in a situation where you’ve had to approach a problem that had many potential solutions; as a more lighthearted example, let us assume that you have been assigned a group project for your software application development class, and need one more team member for your group. You must select between your best friend, Joey, and your neighbor, John. While Joey is not the most diligent nor reliable worker, you’ve been by his side since elementary school and don’t want to tarnish your friendship; you have barely spoken to John and don’t have an extensive history with him, but you know that he’s a very talented UI designer and would make a great asset for your team and you could learn a great deal from him. Through this process, you are subconsciously assessing the risks of selecting one team member over the other; in the grand scheme of project management, project managers are responsible for managing risks throughout the entire project lifecycle. There are six major processes pertaining to project risk management that will ultimately guide you in detecting, assessing and responding to the numerous risks that may arise; these include risk management planning, risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning, and lastly risk monitoring/control. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="risk-management-planning">Risk Management Planning</h2>
      <p>
        The planning process of project risk management, as the name indicates, pertains to establishing a plan for your project team in order to combat prospective risks, regardless of whether they are predicted or unforeseen. Through this process, project teams are expected to iteratively develop this plan as relevant project requirements and information are progressively unveiled. Regardless of this fact, developing a risk management plan should begin very early into the project, as it is quite possible that risk assessment can impact a project’s schedule and budget allocation, and external tools may be required, depending on the nature of the plan. Some of the areas to explore as you develop your team’s plan include the risk management methodology (will you use external tools or create analytical charts?), determining who will be assigned the role of managing a project’s risks, potentially developing a risk breakdown structure, as well as the likelihood and impact of any risk items that could occur during your project. Ultimately, without a responsible plan you may be misdirecting your team toward imminent failure. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="risk-identification">Risk Identification</h2>
      <p>
        Being able to preemptively identify risks that may occur throughout your project’s lifecycle is absolutely essential to proper risk management; a visualization of the risk identification process can be seen below in Figure 1.

      <p>
        These are six effective steps that will help guide you to identify related project risks; template specification is something that should come from forming your risk management plan, as it provides a structure that will assist you in creating what are known as a “risk statement,” which aims to effectively describe each risk by analyzing and explicitly stating their causes, effects, impacts, as well as project areas and events that could be influenced. Basic identification entails a SWOT analysis, through which a team will determine strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that may arise from a particular project-related decision, with the objective of applying previous experiences to the current context and determining if the opportunities outweigh the potential risks that may be incurred. Detailed identification provides a more granular perspective, through some techniques such as brainstorming in order to approach a plausible solution to problems/risks proposed in the previous step. The external cross-check phase involves assessing information that is not necessarily exclusive to the project in order to create a broader, yet more accurate image of the project’s risks. The internal cross-check stage allows the team to ensure that the proposed risks correspond to the project’s scope; in order to do this, a team can compare the risk checklist to the project’s work breakdown structure, which will improve and facilitate the response plan’s creation. The statement finalization stage essentially allows the project team to “fill in the lines” and provide any missing information related to the proposed risks, such as their causes, impacts, and more; this can be accomplished through flowcharting and creating fishbone and influence diagrams. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="qualitative-risk-analysis">Qualitative Risk Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Qualitative risk analysis involves determining the probability and magnitude of identified risks, so that a team can effectively prioritize more impactful risks over others, rather than waste precious resources on a risk that will have virtually no effect on any facets of the project’s development. One of the most common tools that can be leveraged to perform qualitative risk analysis is “Top Ten Risk Item Tracking.” This particular tool provides the top ten risks that threaten a project at any given time through a tabular summary; it could take the form of a monthly ranking, where it ranks each item from 1 to 10 in terms of projected risk for the current month as well as the previous month. In addition to this useful information, it could also include the steps that have been taken in resolving each respective risk item. 
        Through risk management reviews, team members and other stakeholders can remain vigilant and acknowledge major opportunities and threats that could have a role in the project’s development, and interacting with customers and other relevant stakeholders could help improve the team’s ability to respond to each risk in the most appropriate fashion, in order to maximally capitalize on opportunities and avoid dangerous threats. Ultimately, through qualitative risk analysis, the project team can assess each risk and determine which ones should remain a top priority. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="quantitative-risk-analysis">Quantitative Risk Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        While qualitative risk analysis focuses on the magnitude and probability of project risks, quantitative risk analysis focuses specifically on the quantifiable impacts incurred as a result of each risk, such as those relating to a project’s cost and schedule. One technique that can be utilized to help you perform this task is sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis lets you inspect the effects that changing certain project parameters will have on a project and its risks/opportunities. You can use spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel to visibly see these impacts and determine factors such as break even points for project-related profits. Through performing quantitative risk analysis, you are effectively providing clarity for your project so that you better understand how flexible certain project parameters may be, so that you can harness opportunities and avoid adverse effects of manipulating these variables too imprudently. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="risk-response-planning">Risk Response Planning</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important processes related to project risk management is planning how you and your team shall respond to the risks that you have thoroughly assessed and analyzed throughout the aforementioned processes; the most effective strategy, of course, is to mitigate the probability and impact of the most adverse risks and capitalize on the potentially beneficial risks. Some common approaches to negative risks include risk transference and risk mitigation. Regarding the former technique, you will often find that it is not feasible for your team to handle some risks if you lack the necessary tools; for example, if a particular risk could have catastrophic financial impacts on your project and cannot be averted, you may consult a third party for insurance  and warranty that would cover or at least lessen the effects. Risk mitigation, on the other hand, entails taking the initiative to minimize the likelihood of a given risk occurring, which can be accomplished through frequent reviews and monitoring. In terms of positive risks, you would indubitably benefit from maximizing your team’s gains; some common approaches include risk exploitation and risk acceptance. The first of these involves taking every possible measure to maximize the event’s probability of occurring; for example, if you can complete a project three weeks prior to the projected completion date, the project sponsor promises your team will be generously compensated. You determine that this is definitely feasible with minimal risks, so you decide to strive to assign more working hours to each member, motivating them with this reward. Regarding risk acceptance, this simply means that your team determines that no responsive action is necessary in order to seize the benefits of a particular risk. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="monitoring-risks">Monitoring Risks</h2>
      <p>
        The process behind monitoring your project’s risks is one that spans the entire scope of development, as your team will constantly evaluate your management techniques and continue to identify and keep track of risks to ensure that the adverse ones do not ultimately become uncontrollable nor an inevitable force that you can no longer avoid. Through frequent monitoring, you may discover that the likelihood of a critical risk decreased dramatically after the completion of a particular project feature, or that the potential impact was even greater than originally anticipated. Additionally, it’s possible that your response plan was not nearly as effective at resolving major risks as initially projected, so your team may need to alter its strategy or incorporate workarounds, improvised responses to threats where contingency plans are unavailable. Ultimately, through thoroughly and constantly monitoring your project’s risks, you are ensuring that you are optimally prepared to respond to them as they become more formidable.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, it is evident that each of the six major processes involved in project risk management contribute greatly to ensuring that you are able to effectively detect and respond to the myriad risks that could negatively impact your project’s schedule, costs, and even external factors. Through creating an effective plan and learning how to properly categorize and prioritize certain risks based on opportunity and criticality, you will undoubtedly be able to redirect your projects away from danger and toward a path to success and achievement.
