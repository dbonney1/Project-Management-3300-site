      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the lifecycle of a software project, one of the golden rules
        of project management entails maintaining a consistent level of
        engagement between the project development team and the
        project/product’s relevant stakeholders. Stakeholders are the life force
        of virtually all professional projects, and the success of these
        projects is ultimately contingent on stakeholder contribution and
        communication. Through imprudently making decisions that negatively
        impact one of the myriad groups of stakeholders involved in your
        project, this could directly influence these stakeholders’ perception of
        you and your team, even leading to incrimination. Of course, it is
        certainly likely that you do not intentionally harm these highly valued
        groups; on the contrary, this could probably be attributed to
        ineffectively identifying the stakeholders who both influence and are
        affected by your projects. Through properly identifying stakeholders,
        you can initiate a strong relationship that will maximize their
        potential to ensure your projects’ success.
      </p>
      <h2 id="idenifying-stakeholders">Identifying Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>
        From an initial, cursory glance at your project requirements and
        planning documents, identifying stakeholders may seem like a relatively
        simple task; however, to this day, project managers are institutionally
        redefining what does and does not constitute a project stakeholder. For
        example, stakeholders can be either internal or external to a project.
        Internal stakeholders often refer to the project team, sponsors and
        managers directly involved in the development organization. External
        stakeholders not only include your demographic and projected user base,
        but also competitors who may capitalize on missed opportunities, or even
        suppliers and corporate partners who would reap benefits from your
        projects. With this virtually innumerable number of stakeholders
        considered, it is evident that a methodical, tried-and-true approach
        would be quite helpful for identifying relevant groups of stakeholders.
      </p>
      <h2 id="assessing-the-candidates">Assessing the Candidates</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          As you are determining who may and may not qualify as potential
          project stakeholders, it is essential to document the potential
          candidates and measure their relationship to the project at hand. One
          way to accomplish this is through a stakeholder register that
          identifies each stakeholder or group of stakeholders, assesses the
          relationships between them and the project, and classifies them as
          either internal or external stakeholders. However, including every
          individual who has even a modicum of influence on a project can be
          wasteful of both time and resources. Something that can help create a
          more modest, yet still highly effective, list is to ask yourself a
          series of questions as you inspect your stakeholder register. These
          questions include:
        </p>
        <ul class="article-list">
          <li>
            Does the stakeholder fundamentally impact your organization’s
            ability to develop a successful product?
          </li>
          <li>Can you clearly identify what you want from the stakeholder?</li>
          <li>
            Do you want to improve the relationship with this stakeholder?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is the stakeholder dispensable or easily substituted by another
            individual or group?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does another relationship satisfy everything this stakeholder brings
            to the table?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of course, this is only a small set of questions that you should
          consider when determining which ones should remain in the stakeholder
          register, but trimming the fat can help you focus on what is most
          important and carries the greatest degree of influence.
        </p>

      <h2 id="stakeholder-analysis">Stakeholder Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have created a slimmer stakeholder register, one of the most
        effective techniques to follow is what is known as a stakeholder
        analysis. This delves into determining how you should effectively manage
        stakeholder relationships by classifying stakeholders using a variety of
        relevant stakeholder classes. A power/interest grid is a useful tool
        that you can leverage to prioritize stakeholders and measure what level
        of care should be taken to maintain a positive relationship with each
        respective class. An example of a power/interest grid can be seen below
        in Figure 1.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="../images/powerinterest.png" alt="power/interest grid" />
        Figure 1
      </div>
      <p>
        A power/interest grid simplifies things by introducing only four
        categories in which each stakeholder falls: high power, high interest;
        high power, low interest; low power, high interest; lastly, low power,
        low interest. Of course, those with both high power and high interest
        are the upper echelon of stakeholders and should be assigned the
        greatest priority; however, even the low power, low interest
        stakeholders should be acknowledged and given some level of respect
        throughout a project’s development. However, this is only one of the
        many tools that can be used to help you analyze your stakeholder groups.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, it is evident that identifying stakeholders can be a much
        more difficult task than it would initially seem; fortunately, through
        utilizing an effective methodology to analyze potential stakeholders,
        you can assuredly harbor a greater degree of insurance for your project
        and be able to engage the most essential groups throughout your
        project’s planning and development. Through developing and refining a
        stakeholder register, you can form a relatively concise list that
        explicitly reveals each stakeholder group along with the influence that
        they would have on a particular project. Furthermore, a variety of
        helpful tools and techniques, such as power/interest grids, exist that
        can help facilitate the identification and prioritization process.
        Ultimately, through proficiently identifying the important individuals
        and groups that hold a stake in your project, you will be able to more
        effectively ascertain project requirements and goals to ensure a
        successful product.
