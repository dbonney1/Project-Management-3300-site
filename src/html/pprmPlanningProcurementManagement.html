      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The roles and responsibilities of a project manager are, as you are likely aware, quite comprehensive, and even arduous at times. The project development process would be a much simpler task if project managers had to exclusively focus on their project team and the internal environment; however, as project managers continue to evolve and ripen, they will quickly discover that there are many situations in which certain aspects of a project must be delegated to external third parties and services in order to meet time and budgetary constraints. As a new and inexperienced project manager, you likely may be uncertain as to what this arcane procurement management entails. Imprudently relegating essential processes to external organizations without a plan can almost certainly lead to inevitable failure; as such, learning how to properly plan procurement management and leverage relevant tools will push you and your projects in a more rational direction. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="planning-procurement-management">Planning Procurement Management</h2>
      <p>
        The planning process of project procurement management requires you to assess certain sectors of your project and determine where external resources and organizations may need to be utilized in order to streamline the development process. The most pragmatic way to keep track of what resources require the help of an external party is to use a statement of work that defines various features and aspects of your project and individually assess them in order to rationally determine which ones would benefit from external delegation. Once you have created and refined this statement of work, you are able to delve into the bidding process, in which suppliers and other organizations make proposals and bids for your project, and you can analyze each to determine which organization’s offer would be the best fit for your specific project’s needs, environment, and context. Once you have recruited external parties for your project, you are then responsible for managing them; as is the case with your project team and other stakeholders, a constant flow of communication is key to upholding your project’s projected budget and schedule. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="contracts-for-your-plan">Contracts for your Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Through the procurement process, project managers want to be certain that their project’s needs, objectives, and constraints will be satisfied by any procured organizations and resources. This is effectively a conditional process and success is contingent on establishing a formal contract with organizations from whom you are outsourcing project components and responsibilities. However, various contract categories exist, and you should deliberately choose the one that is most appropriate for the conditions that must be met. One classification of contracts is a fixed-price contract; this entails establishing a fixed total price that you would charge the external organization for its services and products that you would require for the features you wish to outsource. You could also assign an explicit delivery date, meaning that this contract would help uphold your project’s budget and schedule. Furthermore, if you wish, you could provide a monetary incentive to the organization for a particularly early delivery date. However, as many may suspect, this particular category of contract entails that you and your project team have well-defined objectives that likely will not change in the future. Another popular contract category is cost-reimbursable, which involves direct project-related fees as well as implicit, indirect expenses. Direct costs are relatively simple to determine since they most often refer to the payment associated with external development and other services, whereas indirect fees may refer to something like a productive workspace. This particular type of contract would be applicable to situations where a team is requesting services that involve a very new technology, and external teams and providers may require additional resources to satisfy their own needs.

      <h2 id="helpful-tools-and-techniques">Helpful Tools and Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        As it would seem, procurement management can be difficult, even for the most seasoned of project managers. Thankfully, a variety of tools and techniques can greatly facilitate the planning process. One common technique is the “make-or-buy analysis,” and the name is pretty indicative of the purpose. Essentially, it involves analyzing various sectors of your projects to determine whether it would be more beneficial to develop a product in-house or simply purchase it from another organization/vendor. Through the make-or-buy analysis, you will compare these two options and establish the expenses associated with selecting either action. More often than not, if you determine that obtaining services or application components from a supplier would be considerably cheaper than delegating the responsibility to your project team, you should most certainly consider doing so. In many situations, you may discover that you are not able to make an educated decision on your own and require a second opinion to reinforce your ability to make the most effective decision. Through expert judgment, you can consult individuals within and outside of your organization who may specialize in a particular aspect of your project that you may potentially want to outsource. Through consulting experts, you may learn of other competitors’ common practices for a similar feature/service (i.e. do they typically implement them themselves or rather rely on a supplier or external development team?), meaning you can potentially adapt them to your own project’s environment. Furthermore, experts may have connections that would help them determine the most reliable and inexpensive suppliers. Ultimately, both internal and external experts can guide you and serve as a valuable reference for planning procurement management.

        In conclusion, it is evident that planning procurement management can be a fairly daunting task, since it involves potentially outsourcing bits and pieces of your project to an unfamiliar third-party organization. However, through appropriate planning and research, you may discover that there could be countless benefits to reap from doing so, rather than simply developing the entire system internally. A variety of helpful tools and techniques exist that can simplify the planning process, and you can mix and match them in order to satisfy your project’s constraints and environment. Ultimately, through proper procurement management, you may find that you encounter a beaming path of prosperity as you develop your professional projects.
