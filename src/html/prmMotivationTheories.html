      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether you have previously managed a project or simply been a team member, you’re likely aware of the fact that low team morale can directly impact the quality of a project’s features, deliverables and infrastructure for the worse. As a project manager, it is your responsibility to wield and take control of the reigns of your team and valiantly lead them to create a successful project. It goes without saying that there are theoretically infinite techniques and methods that you can utilize in order to motivate your team, but motivation theories are abstract concepts that you can leverage and apply to your teams and projects with an incredible potential for success.
      </p>
      <h2 id="motivation-theories">Motivation Theories</h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental idea behind motivation theories is that they strive to explain the reason behind individuals’ motivations and goals, and being able to apply this knowledge to a project-oriented context allows project managers to successfully motivate their team by applying concepts discussed in a given theory. Each theory is inextricably bound to two types of motivation: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation pertains to something that encourages people to do something for pleasure, and extrinsic motivation pertains to more materialistic matters, as it involves receiving a reward or avoiding a penalty as a form of motivation. The needs of a project team must be compartmentalized, as one team member may be more enticed with material gain, while another might find that they are more motivated to participate in an activity for their own enjoyment and nothing more. Four popular motivation theories include Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory, and McClelland’s acquired-needs theory.
      </p>
      <h2 id="hierarchy-of-needs">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h2>
      <p>
        Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, as the name implies, delves into human nature, and forms a tier-based hierarchy of needs based on a variety of human desires. It is frequently portrayed as a pyramid, with each progressive level being dependent on lower tiers of needs. These tiers, from the bottom layer to the top layer, include physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. This is portrayed in Figure 1 below.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        The bottom four tiers are referred to as deficiency needs, and the top tier includes what is known as growth needs. Project managers must remain attentive to team members’ needs based on various situations, such as their desire to be acknowledged for their admirable achievements when developing project features, so that they can strive to ultimately attain growth within their team and the organization. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="motivation-hygiene">Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory</h2>
      <p>
        Through Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory, Herzberg effectively establishes a dichotomy of various factors that are generally associated with job satisfaction and those that are generally associated with job dissatisfaction, which allows project managers to try to cultivate a project environment in a manner that maximizes the qualities that lead to satisfaction while minimizing the more negative characteristics. In order to mitigate dissatisfaction within a team, project managers can strive to create a more optimistic project environment. This can be accomplished by promoting a sense of humility, respect and trust among project team members; members should remain humble toward the work of others as well as their own work, trust that every member is striving to create a successful product, and garner a sense of respect for the project team and working environment. However, it’s additionally important to note that the lack of job dissatisfaction will not necessarily guarantee that a team member will be satisfied in his or her position; the elimination of job dissatisfaction simply ensures that team members will not feel as if their working conditions and environment are hostile/toxic. A project manager must still introduce qualities that will increase overall job satisfaction, such as team and individual recognition, benefits, and other opportunities. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="acquired-needs">McClelland's Acquired-Needs Theory</h2>
      <p>
        While Herzberg’s theory focuses on the need for the presence of job satisfaction and the absence of job dissatisfaction, McClelland’s acquired-needs theory focuses on three primary categories of needs, which include those related to achievement, affiliation, and power. However, these categories are not mutually exclusive, and each and every individual’s motivations vary; in essence, a team member may more strongly desire power within an organization (i.e. a promotion, boost in salary, and the such), while also wanting to have an identity within the team and achieve success in the context of the software team’s professional projects. Project managers must constantly assess their teams in order to determine the driving factors for the team members in order to optimize the degree of motivation and encouragement that the members receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, it is evident that these psychosocially driven motivation theories can help project managers encourage and motivate their teams so that the quality of their projects, features and deliverables do not falter. Each of the mentioned motivation theories establish different fundamental values for individuals and their needs/desires, and project managers can certainly leverage each and morph it to apply to a given project/team environment. By successfully nourishing a team with factors that lead to greater levels of motivation, and striving to mitigate factors that lead to dissatisfaction, it’s almost certain that each and every project manager can garner success from applying the ideas discussed in each of these theories. Ultimately, by doing so, project managers will be able to foster a more optimistic and driven development team so that their professional products/projects can flourish.
