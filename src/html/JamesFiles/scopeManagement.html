      <h1>Project Scope Management</h1>
      <p>
        One of the major knowledge areas of project development includes project
        scope management. This pertains to defining what exactly will be done in
        all of the work included in a project, with a specific attentiveness on
        scale and priorities. Planning, collection of requirements, definition
        of scope, work breakdown structure creation, validation, and scope
        control are all vitally important processes within the project scope
        management knowledge area. Using tools such as these allows for the
        manipulation and management of scope, which is a critically important
        part of project development.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the many key tools in project scope management is the work
        breakdown structure (WBS), which is a task-oriented tree, manifesting as
        a type of chart. It is the foundation upon which scheduling, costs,
        resources, expectations, and adaptations are created. Deliverables are
        broken down into manageable pieces and organized in an approachable way.
        A clear work breakdown structure can make or break the flow of
        productivity within a development team, and its form will vary from team
        to team. Some teams prefer a more visual layout, while others prefer a
        tabular, list based one. Generally, each task within a work breakdown
        structure is known as a work package, or a single “unit of work.” They
        can realistically be thought of as sub-projects of the larger project as
        a whole.

        The first step is resource planning; in this process, a project manager
        identifies the project's resources. This step takes place before any
        work is done. The second step is cost estimation; this is the process of
        attaching a monetary value to the resources required for the project.
        There is a lot of information required for cost estimation, including
        the resource requirements, their price, duration, etc.. The third step
        is cost budgeting; in this step, a project manager will assign the cost
        to each part of a project. The third step also sets up a budget for
        unexpected costs. The last step is cost control; in this step, a project
        manager can increase the budget or reduce work scope. This last step
        takes place throughout the project's entire lifecycle.

        Another topic to mention would be scope creep, which is a critically
        important concept in this knowledge area, referring to the tendency for
        project scope to keep getting bigger and bigger, or “creep”. Oftentimes,
        it can be tempting to raise the requirements and focus of the project as
        the developers and designers themselves become increasingly ambitious
        about what they can accomplish. This leads to the over-expansion of
        requirements and expectations, which are doomed to disappointingly fall
        short. One famous example can be found in the ubiquitous McDonald’s
        Restaurants. In 2001, McDonald’s Restaurants launched an ambitious
        initiative to implement a large interconnected intranet network which
        would allow for real time monitoring of many extremely detailed metrics
        and metadata. Its scope would include every single store(many tens of
        thousands) in 120 countries. McDonald’s invested $170 million on the
        idea, only for it to be prematurely terminated(McDougall). Ambition is
        often an extremely necessary part of any initiative, but left unchecked,
        it can ruin any progress made in the first place.
