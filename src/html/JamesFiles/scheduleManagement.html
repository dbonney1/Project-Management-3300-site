      <h1>Project Schedule Management</h1>
      <p>
        Another of the major knowledge areas of project development includes
        project schedule management. This aspect refers to the timing of the
        project, which involves task fulfillment estimates, timely completion,
        and overall planning/scheduling. In this article, we will explore parts
        of this knowledge area in a question based format, for ease of studying
        and memory retention. For each question, an explanation will be provided
        discussing the reasoning behind each correct answer.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Question 1: Which of the following is NOT an aspect of project schedule
        management?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A. In project schedule management, the next step after sequencing
        activities is to develop the schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. An advantage of the project management software is that it has the
        capacity to calculate the critical path(s) for a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        C. A dependency pertains to the sequencing of project activities or
        tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        D. Knowing the amount of float allows project managers to know whether a
        project schedule is flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...The answer to this question is A! All of the statements included are
        true statements besides this one. In project schedule management, the
        sequence of steps is…
      </p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>1. Plan Schedule Management</li>
        <li>2. Define Activities</li>
        <li>3. Sequence Activities</li>
        <li>4. Estimate Activity Durations</li>
        <li>5. Develop Schedule</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and as you can see, the next step is actually to estimate activity
        durations. Not doing so before developing the schedule could result in a
        completely irrelevant schedule that falls apart upon execution of the
        project schedule management process. Imagine if you came up with the
        schedule assuming that coding the backend would take 1 week, but it
        actually required 2 months! That would be a costly mistake for the
        entire organization.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Question 2: Which of the following is NOT an aspect of project schedule
        management?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A. ‘Free slack’ is used for the amount of time an activity can be
        delayed without delaying the early start date of any immediately
        following activities
      </p>
      <p>
        B. The critical path on a project can change as the project progresses
      </p>
      <p>
        C. Feeding buffers protect tasks on the critical chain from being
        delayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        D. In an AOA network diagram, a ‘merge’ occurs when two or more
        activities follow a single node.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...The answer to this question is D! There is a slight inaccuracy here.
        The term ‘merge’ here should be replaced with ‘burst.’ It’s important to
        understand that a burst is as stated, when two activities follow a
        single node on the chart. A merge is actually when two or more nodes
        precede a single node on the network diagram chart. It’s important to
        understand these concepts personally and deeply in order to communicate
        them in the future in a professional environment. Gaining a common
        understanding with your colleagues on the mechanisms of these
        communicative tools will definitely increase your productivity in the
        long run.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Question 3: Which of the following is NOT an aspect of project schedule
        management?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A. Parkinson’s law states that work expands to fill the time allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. A schedule management plan includes information which describes the
        format and frequency of schedule reports required for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        C. Finish to finish is a dependency in which the “from” activity must be
        finished before the “to” activity can be finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        D. The arrows in a network diagram represent missed milestones in a
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...The answer to this question is D! Network diagrams are useful tools
        for displaying activity sequencing. They are composed of nodes and
        arrows. The arrows in a network diagram actually represent activities or
        even relationships between tasks, while nodes are the start and end
        points of activities. Arrows do NOT represent missed milestones in the
        project. While it is important to keep track of missed milestones,
        that’s not the focus of this specific concept. As stated before, gaining
        a true understanding of network diagrams enables you to communicate on a
        higher level of abstraction with your team members, so it’s important to
        understand these concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another topic to mention would be scope creep, which is a critically
        important concept in this knowledge area, referring to the tendency for
        project scope to keep getting bigger and bigger, or “creep”. Oftentimes,
        it can be tempting to raise the requirements and focus of the project as
        the developers and designers themselves become increasingly ambitious
        about what they can accomplish. This leads to the over-expansion of
        requirements and expectations, which are doomed to disappointingly fall
        short. One famous example can be found in the ubiquitous McDonald’s
        Restaurants. In 2001, McDonald’s Restaurants launched an ambitious
        initiative to implement a large interconnected intranet network which
        would allow for real time monitoring of many extremely detailed metrics
        and metadata. Its scope would include every single store(many tens of
        thousands) in 120 countries. McDonald’s invested $170 million on the
        idea, only for it to be prematurely terminated(McDougall). Ambition is
        often an extremely necessary part of any initiative, but left unchecked,
        it can ruin any progress made in the first place.
