      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you’re an experienced project manager, a freelance developer, or someone who is not even remotely affiliated with software development, you’ve likely had to form a budget in order to prevent an endless spiral of expenses from draining your pockets; if you’re simply creating a weekly budget for groceries, gas and whatnot, estimating the expenses may not seem particularly daunting; however, for a massive software project, being able to properly estimate costs in order to establish a budget is incredibly conducive to success.  
      </p>
      <h2 id="cost-estimates">Cost Estimates</h2>
      <p>
        In order to stay within a project’s established budget, it’s essential to meticulously determine costs; generally, project teams will determine the resources that will be necessary to fully realize the project’s vision, whether internal or external. This could include personnel, software, hardware, and other essential tools. After defining a list of these requirements, a broad cost estimate can be made. In order to properly delve into the subject matter of cost estimates, it’s important to be able to discern between the most common types: rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates, definitive estimates and budgetary estimates.
      </p>
      <h2 id="rom-estimates">ROM Estimates</h2>
      <p>
        ROM estimates have a massive range of potential outcomes (from -25% to 75% in relation to the actual costs of the project), making them a fairly inaccurate tool for forming a cost estimate. This may sound deterring to many, but it’s actually quite applicable to the early stages of a project where this broad range is able to provide a general budget for the project that can be narrowed as the project constraints and requirements become less ambiguous.   
      </p>
      <h3>When should I use this estimate type?</h3>
      <p>
        Generally, ROM estimates are best applicable to the very early stages of a project, and possibly a decent while before the project officially begins. Because of the underwhelming degree of accuracy, they can be used to determine if a proposed project could be feasibly accomplished without spending an inordinate amount of money.
      </p>
      <h2 id="budgetary-estimates">Budgetary Estimates</h2>
      <p>
        Budgetary estimates are used, as the name indicates, to assist the development of a company or organization’s budget; they are to be utilized after the initial stages of a project so that development may properly commence. They are more accurate than ROM estimates, with a range of -10% to +25%.
      </p>
      <h3>When should I use this estimate type?</h3>
      <p>
        Once a project has been approved, and hence determined to be within a feasible range of expenses by virtue of ROM estimates, budgetary estimates can be used to determine a more specific budget set. There still may be a degree of uncertainty regarding the costs of some requirements, but you should be at a point in project planning where most of the requirements have been determined.
      </p>
      <h2 id="definitive-estimates">Definitive Estimates</h2>
      <p>
        In contrast to ROM estimates, definitive estimates are significantly more accurate, flaunting a much more convincing accuracy range of -5% to 10% within the ultimate cost, and can realistically only be created when a comprehensive list of requirements and resources is formed, with little room for error. 
      </p>
      <h3>When should I use this estimate type?</h3>
      <p>
        Because of the greater degree of accuracy, definitive estimates can be applied to situations regarding the acquisition of materials and resources, along with other direct costs where a ballpark approach should not be used. Furthermore, in order to formulate definitive costs, you should have an elaborate project plan in place. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="helpful-tools">Helpful tools for creating cost estimates</h2>
      <p>
        As you are likely aware, developing your cost estimates is certainly easier said than done. As you delve into more ambitious projects, you’ll find that you need some helpful tools to assist you with creating these estimates; thankfully, many techniques exist to facilitate the process and make your job exponentially easier. Some of the most prominent cost estimation techniques include analogous estimating, parametric estimating, bottom-up estimating and three-point estimating. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="analogous-estimating">Analogous Estimating</h2>
      <p>
        Analogous estimates, also referred to as top-down estimates, entail a project manager determining the projected costs of a project by using a previously developed project as a reference point. It is ideal that the project being used as a standard is relatively similar to the project currently being planned/developed. A project manager can create a projection of data points based on the previous project’s costs. While analogous estimates can certainly be difficult, it’s sometimes necessary to concede that no two projects will be completely identical, meaning that this technique is more likely to be a broad generalization and should not be expected to have a significant degree of accuracy; hence, you should use the analogous estimating method in the very early stages of your project’s inception.  
      </p>
      <h2 id="parametric-estimating">Parametric Estimating</h2>
      <p>
        Parametric estimates involve formulating a mathematical model by estimating the costs of a single project “unit” in a given feature/requirement; for example, a project could estimate the price of a feature by assigning a projected cost per line of code, or, in the case of a construction project, the potential cost per square foot of a new house. This would allow a project manager to develop a fairly accurate representation of the project expenses, and therefore be able to create a budget that aligns with the proposed parameters.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bottom-up-estimating">Bottom-Up Estimating</h2>
      <p>
        Bottom-up estimates essentially deconstruct the project into a medley of granular modules, upon which a project manager can estimate the costs of each component; these modules could be divided by features in the context of the software being developed, but they could also be divided by departmental duties and responsibilities, or whatever categories and structural decomposition the project manager finds to be relevant to a particular project. The sum of these parts will equal the projected cost estimate; while this carries a high level of accuracy due to the granularity of project modules, bottom-up estimating can be very costly due to the time it takes to accomplish.
      </p>
      <h2 id="three-point-estimating">Three-Point Estimating</h2>
      <p>
        Three-point estimates, as the name implies, involve the project manager creating three different estimates, represented by “points;” these include an optimistic estimate, a pessimistic estimate and a most-likely estimate. The optimistic estimate entails the project being developed and funds being allocated in the most efficient way possible; the pessimistic estimate assumes the possibility where the project is developed and funds are allocated in the least efficient way possible; the most-likely estimate pertains to the scenario that is the most probable outcome, and will lie at a point between the two aforementioned points, and, similarly to the parametric estimating technique, a mathematical assessment will be applied to determine where this “most-likely” point lies, which will serve as the projected project budget estimate.  
      </p>
      <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>
        Ultimately, it’s evident that, as a project manager, developing your project cost estimates can be incredibly taxing due to the varying level of accuracy present in each of the major cost estimate types, and understanding how to apply cost estimates to a project and uncover the most accurate budget estimate for a particular project environment can be equally difficult. Thankfully, numerous techniques can be utilized in order to facilitate this process and provide a safety net for project managers as they plan and develop their professional projects.
