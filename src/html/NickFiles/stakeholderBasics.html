      <h1>Project Stakeholder Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is project stakeholder management?</h2>
      <p>
        To make a project a success, a project manager must make sure a project
        meets all of its objectives and fulfills the projects' expectations.
        During the duration of a project manager must control stakeholder's
        expectations and requirements. A project manager should aim to determine
        each stakeholder's goals and why they were willing to invest.
      </p>
      <h2>Stakeholder Management plan</h2>
      <h3>List Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        The first is to sort stakeholders into two different groups, internal
        and external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders are typically
        department heads within the company. External stakeholders are made up
        of investors, users, media, and other businesses.
      </p>
      <h3>Prioritize Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Prioritizing stakeholders means determining which external stakeholders
        have the most significant influence on the project. This also means
        noting at which stages in the project a specific stakeholder has more
        influence.
      </p>
      <h3>Interview Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different questions you can ask a stakeholder during this
        phase. For example, "why are you interested in this project," "what are
        your expectations for this project," "How quickly do you see this
        project rolling out." All of the questions you ask a stakeholder are
        used to understand whether they feel positive or negative about the
        project.
      </p>
      <h3>Manage Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        This is the essential phase of your project stakeholder management plan.
        During this phase, a project manager will identify which stakeholders
        will be more involved in each stage. Project managers will create a
        timeline for when stakeholders need to provide feedback.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        To summarize, project stakeholder management is categorizing
        stakeholders and determining when each stakeholder has more influence in
        each stage of a project. A project manager's goal is to fulfill all of
        the expectations of its stakeholders.
