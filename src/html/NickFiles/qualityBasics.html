      <h1>Project Quality Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is project cost management?</h2>
      <p>
        Project quality management is about the process and activities
        associated with figuring out and achieving the quality of a project's
        deliverables. Quality is a vague word, however. In the case of project
        quality management, quality is simply what the customer or stakeholder
        needs or wants from a project. By keeping the focus of project quality
        management on the customer and stakeholder, the focus can be more narrow
        and have a better chance of achieving its goals.
      </p>
      <h2>Concepts of quality management</h2>
      <h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>
      <p>
        Even if a deliverable meets every requirement outlined by the customer
        and stakeholders, there is a chance that the finished product is not
        satisfactory. While creating a deliverable, a project manager should
        frequently meet with stakeholders to update them on the progress and get
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of continuous improvement is that there will be an ongoing
        effort through a project to improve aspects of the project. By applying
        this concept, a project manager will continuously monitor and document
        any issues that arise.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, project quality management is about figuring the
        activities required to make a good deliverable. Some project quality
        management concepts are customer satisfaction, where customers and
        stakeholders provide feedback, and continuous improvement, where an
        issue is documented and improved on through a project's lifetime.
