      <h1>Project Cost Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is project cost management?</h2>
      <p>
        Project cost management includes budgeting, estimating, and controlling
        costs during a project's life cycle. Through project cost management, a
        company can predict incoming expenses in or reduce the chances of the
        project going over budget. A project's project cost is calculated during
        the planning phase. All costs that are incurred are noted to make sure
        things stay within the predetermined budget.
      </p>
      <h2>Why project cost management is important?</h2>
      <p>
        The reason why project cost management is essential is simple. Before
        you decide to spend a large amount of money on something, you have to
        decide how much you will spend. When that amount is decided, a project
        manager can decide how much to spend on each sub-task.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps of project cost management</h2>
      <p>
        The first step is resource planning; in this process, a project manager
        identifies the project's resources. This step takes place before any
        work is done. The second step is cost estimation; this is the process of
        attaching a monetary value to the resources required for the project.
        There is a lot of information required for cost estimation, including
        the resource requirements, their price, duration, etc.. The third step
        is cost budgeting; in this step, a project manager will assign the cost
        to each part of a project. The third step also sets up a budget for
        unexpected costs. The last step is cost control; in this step, a project
        manager can increase the budget or reduce work scope. This last step
        takes place throughout the project's entire lifecycle.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Project cost management is the process where a project manager manages a
        project budget and costs. Project cost management is essential because
        it allows a manager to estimate how much is needed to complete a project
        and allocate money to a project's sub-tasks. Project cost management is
        separated into four steps, project resource planning, cost estimation,
        cost budgeting, and cost control.
