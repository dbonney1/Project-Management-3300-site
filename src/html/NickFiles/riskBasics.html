      <h1>Project Risk Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is project risk management?</h2>
      <p>
        Project risk management is a technique used by project managers to
        reduce the risk of potential problems that could harm a project. A risk
        includes anything or event that could affect workers, processes,
        technology, or resources involved in the project. One way risk is
        different from an issue is that risk is not something that a project
        manager can predict.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a positive risk?</h2>
      <p>
        The word risk is usually associated with negative things like someone
        becoming ill and unable to work or someone breaking a component for a
        project. However, some things are considered positive risks. Risks that
        could be considered positive could be finishing the project early or
        getting more customers than you expected.
      </p>
      <h2>Response to positive risk</h2>
      <p>
        First, a project manager needs to assess the risk and determine if it
        can exploit and its likelihood of occurring. Next, the risk must be
        shared. The project might not be able to take full advantage of the
        risk, and by involving other people, the chance of yielding a positive
        result increases. Finally, there may be nothing to do whatsoever. This
        applies to adverse risks as well because sometimes doing nothing is your
        best option.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps in the risk management process</h2>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Identify the risk</li>
        <li>Analyze the risk</li>
        <li>Prioritize the risk</li>
        <li>Assign an owner to the risk</li>
        <li>Respond to the risk</li>
        <li>Monitor the risk</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Project risk management is about reducing the chance of risks negatively
        affecting the course of a project. There are both positive and negative
        risks, and both can be dealt with in similar ways. Sometimes your best
        option may be doing nothing at all.
