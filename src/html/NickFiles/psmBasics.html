      <h1>Project Scope Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is Project Scope Management</h2>
      <p>
        Project scope management is a set of processes that define what goes
        into a project and what factors make the project a success. Project
        scope management is used to accurately define the work that needs to be
        done to deliver a product similar to the product scope. Project scope
        management also allows a project manager to distribute the workload to
        complete a project accurately successfully
      </p>
      <h2>Why Project Scope Management is important</h2>
      <p>
        One reason why project scope management is critical is that when a scope
        is designed, it helps keep everyone on the same page, clients, and
        stakeholders. With a defined scope, it can help to avoid many common
        problems like requirements changing and projects falling behind
        schedule. Project scope can help distinguish what is involved in the
        project and what is not.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Project Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Project scope is a detailed set of deliverables and or features of a
        project. The deliverables are retrieved from the requirements of the
        project. Project scope is defined as the work that is needed to be done
        to deliver a product with the specified features and functions. The
        project scope should not be confused with the Product Scope. Product
        scope is defined as the functions and features that characterize what
        the product being created will be.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps involved in Project Scope Management</h2>
      <p>
        The steps in project scope management can be defined in three simple
        categories. One is defining the needs of the project. Defining the needs
        of the project includes establishing a timeline, allocating resources,
        and setting up project goals. When all of these previously mentioned
        things are established, a project manager can analyze what work needs to
        be done and how to allocate it. The second step is about understanding
        the project objectives. Before defining the scope, a project manager
        must establish objectives. These objectives could be adding features or
        services or creating something entirely new. Once the objectives are
        set, a project manager can start looking at defining the project scope.
        The project's scope is the resources that go into the creation of the
        project objectives. The scope outlines the goal that needs to be
        achieved to have a successful project.
      </p>
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        o Project scope management is a process where a guide is laid out to
        follow to create a successful product by defining a project's needs,
        understanding the project objectives, and defining project scope. By
        following the listed steps, a project manager can avoid having issues
        during a project's timeline.
