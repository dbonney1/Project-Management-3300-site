      <h1>Project Communication Management Basics</h1>
      <h2>What is project communication management?</h2>
      <p>
        Communication is the key to success for any type of project. According
        to PMI (Project Management Institute) most project failures are due to
        issues with interpersonal communication. Project communication
        management is used to ensure communication issue are not a problem.
        Project communication management consists of three processes that make
        sure the correct messages are sent, received, and understood by the
        correct individuals. The three processes include plan communications
        management, manage communications, and monitor communications.
      </p>
      <h2>Plan Communications Management</h2>
      <p>
        This first step is to plan how you will manage communication across all
        stakeholders. This is done by creating a communications management plan.
        The factors that need to be addressed are, audience, which is a list of
        all stakeholders including team members, sponsors, and customers.
        Objective, which is the purpose of your communications. Message, which
        is the actual content shared. Channel, this is how the message will be
        delivered.
      </p>
      <h2>Manage Communications</h2>
      <p>
        After the communications management plan is created it is the project
        managers role to manage it. This means that a manager will consistently
        review the plan and update it as needed to reflect the ongoing changes
        of the project. A manager will collect and analyze data, create
        messages, distribute communications, storage of communications reports
        and files, retrieval of stored communications, and the disposal of
        communications after the closure of the project.
      </p>
      <h2>Monitor Communications</h2>
      <p>
        This process is about monitoring and controlling communications
        throughout the lifetime of a project. This includes making sure
        communications were sent out, confirming communications were received by
        the proper people, making sure communications were understood, and
        confirming feedback was provided to the correct project members.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Project communication management ensures proper communication throughout
        the duration of a project. This is accomplished by the three primary
        project communication management processes. The three primary project
        communications management processes are plan communication management,
        management communications, and monitor communications.
